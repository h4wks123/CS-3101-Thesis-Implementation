# # CS-3101-Thesis-Implementation

Welcome to the CS-3101-Thesis-Implementation repository!

This repository contains the implementation of the thesis project for CS-3101, titled "Image Classification of Venomous Snakes in the Philippines with Ensembled Transfer Learning". The project aims to classify venomous and non-venomous snakes from the Philippines using images scraped online.

Please note that this implementation is still a work in progress. While significant progress has been made, there are ongoing developments and refinements being made to enhance the functionality and performance of the system.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for your interest in the CS-3101-Thesis-Implementation project!
